> "If they'd just learn how to use it _correctly_..."

Most of the time, your API is going to give someone access to some small piece
of data or functionality, and learning how to use it is another footnote among
the thousand things that need to be done in order to deliver some product.
People are going to swoop into your documentation (you have that, right?), pick
the first thing that sort of looks like it will work, try it, and then move on.
Rather than lament that the unworthy masses aren't doing their homework, you
need to _design_ with their limited time in mind.

Design for this with sane defaults and documentation.

# If we could just _finish_ it...

_It's never finished._

Read that again. You're not writing TeX. You may have a bold vision for how this
API will develop, and that's fantastic. But you still need to deliver on that
vision one step at a time, and every iteration needs to be useful and
maintainable.

It's hard to find the time to deliver version 2 if you spend all your time
putting out the fires of version 1. Always assume that the next milestone you
deliver is going to be the last.

XQueue is actually a pretty horrible idea.
