_It's never finished._

Read that again. You're not writing [TeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX).
You may have a bold vision for how this API will develop, and that's fantastic.
But you still need to deliver on that vision one step at a time, and every
iteration needs to be useful and maintainable.

It's hard to find the time to deliver version 2 if you spend all your time
putting out the fires of version 1. Always assume that the next milestone you
deliver is going to be the last.

Sometimes that's a tradeoff you're willing to make. Sometimes the market
opportunity is too important and the company ceases to exist if you don't cut
that corner and create a maintenance nightmare. But understand the costs and
don't kid yourself that you'll get time to go back and fix it. If your company
is on a knife's edge when you make that tradeoff, it's quite likely that you'll
still be in crisis mode next month.

The best you can do is question very hard whether you *really* need that one
feature, and whether there are any more maintainable alternatives that are
almost as good.
